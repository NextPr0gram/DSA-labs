 * 
 * A lottery needs to know what tickets have been sold. 
 * To facilitate the drawing of winning numbers, it needs to know the
 * complete set of available numbers. It also needs to keep track of 
 * the current winning numbers so as to check if anybody has won in
 * the current lottery session.  
 * 
 * It sells lottery ticket and runs a lottery draw. 
 * It can find out who has won and 
 * can reset all knowledge so as to prepare for
 * running the next lottery session.
